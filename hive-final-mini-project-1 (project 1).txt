--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. create database 
hive_project_one

2. create table first 

3. create table second


4. location in hdfs is /hive_project_one












-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Create a schema based on the given dataset
create table first 
(
Sr_no int,
date string,
agent_name string,
total_chats int,
avg_response_time string,
avg_resolution_time string,
avg_rating float,
total_feedback int 
)
row format delimited
fields terminated by ','
tblproperties("skip.header.line.count"="1");

2. Dump the data inside the hdfs in the given schema location.
load data inpath '/hive_project_one/AgentPerformance.csv' into table first;

3. List of all agents' names. 
select agent_name as unique_agents from first group by agent_name; 

4. Find out agent average rating.
select agent_name,avg_rating from first group by agent_name,avg_rating;

5. Total working days for each agents 


6. Total query that each agent have taken 
select agent_name,sum(total_chats) as total_chats_per_agent from first group by agent_name;

7. Total Feedback that each agent have received 
select agent_name,sum(total_feedback) as total_feedback_per_agent from first group by agent_name;

8. Agent name who have average rating between 3.5 to 4
select agent_name,avg_rating from first where avg_rating>=3.5 AND avg_rating<=4 group by agent_name,avg_rating;
 
9. Agent name who have rating less than 3.5 
select agent_name,avg_rating from first where avg_rating<3.5 group by agent_name,avg_rating;

10. Agent name who have rating more than 4.5 
select agent_name,avg_rating from first where avg_rating>4.5 group by agent_name,avg_rating;

11. How many feedback agents have received more than 4.5 average


12. average weekly response time for each agent 


13. average weekly resolution time for each agents 


14. Find the number of chat on which they have received a feedback 
select sum(total_chats) as chats_with_feedback from first where total_feedback != 0;

15. Total contribution hour for each and every agents weekly basis 
second table



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
16. Perform inner join, left join and right join based on the agent column and after joining the table export that data into your local system.


17. Perform partitioning on top of the agent column and then on top of that perform bucketing for each partitioning.
